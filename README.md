## <a name="about-this-project"></a> About this project
Many people have frequent doctor visits (sometimes more than once per week), but they lack a system for accurately and effectively keeping track of their health data, including upcoming appointments, prescriptions, symptoms they experience outside of the doctor's office, doctor's notes, height and weight measurements, and symptom-specific information.

Because it is frequently printed on paper and dispersed across numerous papers and folders, managing all that information may be quite a challenge. Furthermore, data frequently comes from a variety of medical practises and hospitals. Also, there is no one, central location where the data can be kept. For instance, even when an appointment is made on paper, the notes related to it are kept in a different notebook. You might encounter a symptom outside of the doctor's office, but you don't note it and forget to mention it to your doctor when you go for your next appointment. As you can see, there are a lot of issues with how people are currently managing their health. It takes a lot of time to manually keep track of this data. As a result, this information can easily be lost, misplaced, or forgotten over time.

It is safe to conclude that it is challenging to manage our health information. Trying to manage that information for someone else makes it even more complicated and difficult (for example, for a child or grandparent).

 This is where HealthTracker comes in. HealthTracker is a web application that allows you to log and keep track of health information so that you can easily share and discuss that information with your doctor(s) during your next visit. It is <b>one app</b> that you can use to create and maintain a health journal for yourself or for another person. No more having to carry around bulky notebooks, papers, and files to each and every doctor visit. Instead, all you need to do is bring your tablet to the doctor office, open up the app, and all the relevant information is there for the doctor to see.

### <a name="how-the-app-is-built"></a> How the app is built
On the front end side, this project is built using React, which is an open-source Javascript library developed at Facebook specifically for the task of developing user interfaces. React relies on a component-based architecture where elements of the user interface are broken into small chunks of code called components. Material UI is a css framework that helps with building these components. Material UI is a React component library that implements Googleâ€™s material design.

On the back end side, this project uses MongoDB, Node, Express, Passport, and various third party packages. Node, MongoDB, and Mongoose are used to query and route data in the app. Express is the backend web framework used for this app. Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js (that is, the technology used to log users into the app). 

### <a name="workflow"></a> App workflow

#### Authentication
When you first visit the app, you will be prompted to log in (if you have already created an account) or sign up (if you are a new user). To sign up, you will need to provide an email address as well as create a username and password. Authentication is required because it ensures that a user's health information is protected and blocked from other users.

#### Home 
After you authenticate, you are taken to the Home/Landing page. From this page, you can navigate to all the different pages with the app to keep track of your health information.

#### My health log
The My health log page is where you can manually record doctor appointment information, including doctor being seen, date of visit, reason for visit, weight, height, and visit notes. You can track your height and weight measurements over time from the Charts page.

#### My symptom journal
The My symptom journal page is a log of symptoms that you can share with your doctor at your next doctor visit. You can record symptoms you experience away from the doctor office, the time when the symptom occurred, and add comments to each entry. You have a list of symptoms to choose from (for example, Dizzy, Shortness of Breath, Fainted, Swelling, Heart Fluttering, Fatigue, Other). You have a text field where you can enter more information about a symptom and list any useful information that will help you remember details of the symptom when you see your doctor at your next visit.

#### Appointments
The Appointments page lists your upcoming appoinments and related information in table format. You can add and remove appointments from this page.

#### Prescriptions
The Prescriptions page is where you can enter information about medications prescribed by your doctor, including prescription name, name of doctor who prescribed the medication, date prescribed, number of tablets, and directions for use.

#### Doctors and clinics
The Doctors and clinics page has contact information for each of your doctors, such as doctor name, email address, and office location. You can also add contact information for each clinic. After you add your doctors and clinics, you can associate these doctors and clinics with other information, such as appointments, in the app.

#### Charts
The Charts page includes two line graphs. The top graph displays your weight data over time. This data is pulled from the weight measurements you entered on the My health log page. The second graph is similar. It displays your height data over time.

### <a name="project-structure"></a> Structure of the project

After you clone the repository, navigate to the project root directory (MedLog). The project directory structure is set up as follows:

* <b>client</b>
  * <b>public</b>: The public folder contains the index.html file. This HTML file is a template. The file is empty. So, if you open it directly in a browser, you will get an empty page. Rather than placing the HTML code directly in index.html, this app uses a React component-based architecture to create, build, and render UI components to the page.
  * <b>src</b>: The src folder is where the React app components reside.
    * <b>assets</b>: Contains the images/icons used in the app.
    * <b>index.js</b>: The index.js file is the top level file of the React app. In index.js, the App.js file is imported, and the ReactDOM.render method is used to render App.js to the page.
    * <b>App.js</b>: The App.js file is where the app components are imported and rendered, such as the navigation bar, footer, and various pages.
    * <b>Components</b>: The Components folder is where the app components that are reused across the app are located. Each file represents a separate component. For example, AppBar.js is the top navigation bar component.
    * <b>containers</b>: Holds all the pages of the app and the child components within those pages. For example, inside of the containers folder, there is an Appointments folder. The Appointments folder contains a top-level parent container/page called Appointments.js that has two child containers (AppointmentsForm.js and AppointmentsList.js).
    * <b>utils</b>: Contains all the axios requests used to get health information from the database.
    * <b>App.css</b> and <b>index.css</b>: The external css stylesheets for the app.
  * <b>package.json</b>: Lists the project dependencies and their version numbers.
  * <b>yarn.lock</b>: Dependency tree for the project. Lists all the client dependencies and their versions.
* <b>Controllers</b>: The controllers are the routes that are used to pass information to and from the view and model objects.
* <b>models</b>: The models define the database schema or structure of the database.
* <b>routes</b>: These files are the key to how the back end and front end can communicate with each other. They give the server a map of how to respond when users visit or request data from various URLs.
* <b>scripts</b>
  * <b>build.js</b>: Run <b>yarn build</b> in the project root directory to create a production build of the app, which you can use to deploy the app to Heroku.
  * <b>seedDB.js</b>: Run <b>yarn seed</b> to populate your development database with information.
  * <b>start-client</b>: Script used to start the React development server.
* <b>.eslintrc.js</b>: List of rules and their definitions for ESLint.
* <b>.gitignore</b>: Anything listed inside this file (for example, node_modules) will not be tracked by GitHub or Heroku when code is committed.
* <b>package.json</b>: Lists the project dependencies and their version numbers. It also contains various scripts to start the server, create a production build, seed the database, etc.
* <b>Procfile</b>: This file tells Heroku to run the server file with node once it's built.
* <b>server.js</b>: This file does the following:
  * Defines and requires the dependencies, including express, body-parser, and mongoose.
  * Sets up the Express server to handle data parsing using body-parser.
  * Points the server to the API routes, which gives the server a map of how to respond when users visit or request data from various URLs.
  * Defines the port the server is listening on.
  * Starts the server and React server.
  * Allows the app to serve static content.
  * Sets up Passport, which allows the user to authenticate/log in to the app.
  * Uses Mongoose (orm) to connect to MongoDB, which allows us to have access to the MongoDB commands to perform various operations on the database.
* <b>yarn.lock</b>: Dependency tree for the project. Lists the project dependencies and their versions.
